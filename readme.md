# Introduction

A very simple [omp server](https://github.com/openmultiplayer/open.mp/releases) template that based on [samp-node](https://github.com/AmyrAhmady/samp-node) and uses the library [@infernus/core](https://github.com/dockfries/omp-node)

## Features

- 🥳 [open.mp](https://github.com/openmultiplayer) for the next generation
- 🚀 fully embrace the powerful node.js ecosystem
- 🎉 i18n support for different charsets depending on the player
- 💡 better data types and asynchronous support

## Preparation

> **The necessary files were removed** to ensure that the latest version is always used and that the repository file size is reduced

1. Download the [omp server](https://github.com/openmultiplayer/open.mp/releases), later extract the `omp-server[.exe]` and `components` folder to the project root directory
2. Download the [samp-node](https://github.com/AmyrAhmady/samp-node/releases), later put `libnode.so/dll` in the project root directory and `samp-node.so/dll` in the plugins folder
3. Download the [streamer plugin](https://github.com/samp-incognito/samp-streamer-plugin/releases), later put `streamer.so/dll` in the plugins folder

## Getting started

```sh
# clone the project with https
git clone https://github.com/dockfries/omp-node-starter
# or ssh
git clone git@github.com:dockfries/omp-node-starter.git

# enter the project directory
cd omp-node-starter

# install dependency
pnpm install

# change rcon.password in config.json
vim config.json

"rcon": {
  "password": "changeme" # change this
},

# develop (start compilation, listen for changes and restart automatically)
pnpm dev
```

## Build

```sh
# build for production environment
pnpm build

# run omp server
pnpm serve
```

## Notice

- [Why does crash the first time you run it?](https://github.com/dockfries/omp-node-starter/issues/12)
- `samp-node` plugin should be executed after other plugins, see `config.json -> pawn.legacy_plugins`
- `samp-node` requires compliance with the `commonjs` specification and has been converted via `rollup`
